Library to help with internationalization. WIP. Nightly only: uses `proc_macros`.


## Status

This library is very young and very unfinished. Please note that I don't know
anything about internationalization and that I never used an i18n library
before. I developed this library because I needed something like this for a
web project of mine. This web project will drive the development of this
library: experience from using the library in a real project helps a lot to
shape the API of this library.
